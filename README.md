### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a developer who likes to express my imagination on a computer. I'm a junior in Yeungnam University in South Korea. And I majored in Computer Science. I am interested in A.I, so I have participated in various contests related in A.I and also have awards. I often feel the lack of design part while working on projects, so I am currently interested in UI and UX.
